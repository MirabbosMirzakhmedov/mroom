1) in "settings.py" -> "allowed apps": it's showing type in word 'corsheaders',
but you dont have it. Maybe it is some kind of a mistake?

2) "run_playground.py" does not run in "gitBash".

3) 'git' command does not work in Pycharm terminal

4) Do most of the frontend developers use templates when creating a project?
    Is it legal?
        If yes: then, I understand how frontend work, can I work with clients already with my knowledge?

5) indentation in html file does not work for me.

6) Mobile Navigation does not work for me.
